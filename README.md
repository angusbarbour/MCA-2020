# Project Debussy
<h2>  Week 1 </h2>
The central theme surrounding my MCA project will be the work of composer Claude Debussy.


Lots of data regarding Debussy's work has been manifested by many organisations and curators. The Digital Resources of Musicology have curated some notated data in the form Debussys old sheet music, the exact manuscripts of some of his music scores. The DRM also provide some minute descriptive meta data on the pieces such as NAME, DATE and Version. 
Other datasets such as the Live Music Archive have curated some accoustic data of Debussy's music being played. This data is presented via waveforms and audio and is visable and audible to the viewer. The audio has been presented alongside some basic descriptive metadata that tells us the Title, band, genre, length and more.
