  <h1> Week 2: Notated Music </h1>
  <p> This week I had decide on what piece of music I was going to transcribe for my project. I decided on a piece from Claude Debussy's Suite Bergamasque: Passepied.
  I was able to locate a scan in of the orginal sheet music arranged for piana by Debussy himself. I found this via the IMSLP music database,
  the link to the database can be found <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Debussy,_Claude">here.</a> <br> <br>
  For this weeks activity I was required to transcribe 10 bars from this sheet music, the PDF document of the original score can be found <a href="https://github.com/angusbarbour/MCA-2020/blob/master/suite_bergamasque.pdf">here.</a> <br> <br>
  My 10 bar transcription can be viewed below: <br> <img src="https://github.com/angusbarbour/MCA-2020/blob/master/Tasks/Week2/Passepied_image.JPG">
