# __MCA 2020__
 ## _Week 1_ 
The central theme surrounding my MCA project will be the work of composer Claude Debussy.


Lots of data regarding Debussy's work has been manifested by many organisations and curators. The Digital Resources of Musicology have curated some notated data in the form Debussys old sheet music, the exact manuscripts of some of his music scores. The DRM also provide some minute descriptive meta data on the pieces such as NAME, DATE and Version. 
Other datasets such as the Live Music Archive have curated some accoustic data of Debussy's music being played. This data is presented via waveforms and audio and is visable and audible to the viewer. The audio has been presented alongside some basic descriptive metadata that tells us the Title, band, genre, length and more. 

## _Week 2_ 
This week I had decide on what piece of music I was going to transcribe for my project. I decided on a piece from Claude Debussy's Suite Bergamasque: Passepied. I was able to locate a scan in of the orginal sheet music arranged for piana by Debussy himself. I found this via the IMSLP music database, the link to the database can be found [here](https://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Debussy,_Claude).

For this weeks activity I was required to transcribe 10 bars from this sheet music, the PDF document of the original score can be found [here.](https://github.com/angusbarbour/MCA-2020/blob/master/suite_bergamasque.pdf).

My 10 bar transcription can be viewed below:

## _Week 3_
__Task one:__
For this weeks task I was required to take the score that I created last week, and convert it into two different formats: musicxml and mei. I achieved the musicxml file by simply exporting my score from musescore as an XML file. However, to obtain the mei file I had to use Verovio in order to get this format. Both of my files can be seen down below:

* [mei file](https://github.com/angusbarbour/MCA-2020/blob/master/data/Passepied_redo.mei)
* [Musicxml file](https://github.com/angusbarbour/MCA-2020/blob/master/data/Passepied.musicxml)

__Task two:__ For the second task, I was to successful render my MEI file using the Verovio app. I was able to do this and the rendered vervio file can be found [here](https://angusbarbour.github.io/MCA-2020/verovio.html)


## _Week 4_
This week I was given the task of generating a JSymbolic, and using it to extract some intersting features relevant to my song. I have listed the JSymbolic extracted features below:
* Number of Pitches: 23
* Number of Pitch Classes: 8
* Range: 36
* Strong Tonal Centres: 2
* Mean Pitch: 58
* Mean Pitch Class: 5.445
* Most Common Pitch: 49
* Most Common Pitch Class: 1
* Interval Between Most Prevelant Pitches: 5
* Pitch Variability: 9.531
* Most Common Melodic Interval: 7
I have selected a few features to be extracted that I think are interesting for my song. Passepied is a song that sounds very much like you are being taken on a journey, and I wanted to know if this had anything to do with the range in notes or the number of pitches. This is why I decided to extract range and number of pitches. Although the range is only 36, it is important to note that the JSymbolic only reported 10 bars of my piece, which may explain why the number was not as high as I had anticipated. However, for only 10 bars I would argue that 23 different pitches is relatively high. It is also to be taken into account that the first 10 bars of this song are quite repitive and follow the same pitch pattern, this may be the reason for the relatively mediocore numbers.
